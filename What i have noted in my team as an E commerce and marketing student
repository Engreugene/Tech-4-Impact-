As an  *E-commerce & Marketing Student* in my team, my  role is *critical* in shaping how the site *attracts, engages, and converts* users.

2. *E-commerce Strategy*
- Define *product categories*, price ranges, and value propositions.
- Recommend *payment options* (e.g. Paystack, Flutterwave, Stripe).
- Plan *delivery/shipping models* (if relevant).
- Suggest *return/refund policies* that build trust.

3. *Marketing Plan*
- *Digital Channels*: Email, SEO, Google Ads, Social Media (Instagram, X, TikTok).
- *Launch Campaign*: Tease features, offer pre-launch sign-ups, promo codes.
- *Influencer or Affiliate Strategy* (if relevant to your niche).

4. *Conversion Optimization*
